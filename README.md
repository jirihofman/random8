# Random8
**Random8** enables you to quickly get and generate random values such as: email addresses, names, numbers, passwords and strings (uuid, code, hash). It was developed for personal use where I dealt with random data on daily basis as a software developer. 
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.astro`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
## Astro
This is an [Astro](https://astro.build/) project with React components for optimal performance and minimal bundle size.
