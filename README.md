# Random8
**Random8** enables you to quickly get and generate random values such as: email addresses, names, numbers, passwords and strings (uuid, code, hash). It was developed for personal use where I dealt with random data on daily basis as a software developer. 
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
## Next.js
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
